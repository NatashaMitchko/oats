# Oat Reminder

A little aws lambda function powered by twilio and triggered by a cloudwatch scheduled event. Every night it'll text me to remind me to make overnight oats (or chia pudding which I actually much prefer). I guess it'll keep reminding me until I run out of money in my twilio trial account.
